# Phonebook Management System (BST-based)

## Project Overview
This project is a **Phonebook Management System** implemented using **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and **Linked Lists** in **Java**. The system allows users to store, search, update, and delete contacts efficiently while also managing events and appointments.

The phonebook maintains **contacts** with attributes such as: 
- Name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Address
- Birthday
- Notes

Additionally, it supports **event scheduling**, where users can:
- Schedule events and appointments.
- Link contacts to events.
- Search for events based on names or contacts.
- Manage scheduled events efficiently.

## Features
**Efficient Contact Management**: Add, search, update, and delete contacts using BST.  
**Event & Appointment Scheduling**: Assign contacts to events and track scheduled meetings.  
**Multiple Search Criteria**: Find contacts by name, phone, email, or address.  
**BST-based Storage**: Ensures fast searching and retrieval of contact details.  
**Linked List Implementation**: Used for managing events associated with contacts.  

## File Structure
- **Phonebook.java** → The main program, handles user interaction and system logic.
- **BST.java** → Implements the Binary Search Tree for storing and searching contacts.
- **LinkedList.java** → Implements linked lists for managing event lists.
- **Contact.java** → Defines the contact structure and properties.
- **Event.java** → Defines event properties and methods.
